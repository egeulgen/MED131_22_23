# Data

We'll create our own data for this exercise:

```{r}
tumor_size_df <- data.frame(size = c(3, 4, 5, 6, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7, 8, 9, 10),
                            group = c("A","A","A","A","B","B","B","B","C","C","C","C"))
tumor_size_df
```

Let's visualize the data:

```{r}
boxplot(tumor_size_df$size~tumor_size_df$group, xlab = "Group", ylab = "Tumor Size")
```

# ANOVA 

```{r}
res_aov <- aov(size ~ group, data = tumor_size_df)
summary(res_aov)
```

# Post-hoc Test

```{r}
TukeyHSD(res_aov)
```
